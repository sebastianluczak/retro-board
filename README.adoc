== Business need

Have some columns with cards that you can move around.

Changes are broadcast to all connected clients via WebSockets.

Supported User Actions:

- [x] creation of a board with username
- [x] adding new cards
- [x] moving cards between columns (drop card on "New card" button)
- [x] changing contents of a card to be broadcast to other users immediately

=== Roadmap

NOTE: Some features may or may not be added based on my leniency.

- [ ] deleting cards
- [ ] ownership of boards, with additional features for owners
- [ ] ownership of cards, to not be able to modify other's cards
- [ ] image support in cards, especially for memes and gifs
- [ ] better architecture of FE and BE

== Technology stack

- TypeScript
- Backend: NestJS
- Frontend: React + NextJS
